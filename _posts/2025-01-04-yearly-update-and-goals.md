## Year in Review: Pregnancy, Birth And Other Things

2024 was a very important year for me, both personally and professionally.

Personally, we gave birth to a baby boy on December 16th. The six-hour labor was life-changing. I witnessed firsthand how strong my wife is, both physically and mentally.

It all started with her water breaking early in the morning of her scheduled induction. I was very scared for both my wife and the baby, but my wife was very calm. At around 3:55 AM, we started labor and delivery and were soon admitted. The pain my wife experienced went from a 0 to about a 10 in two hours. She still held strong for two more hours. I helped her wherever I could, but I was really impressed by her strength. Even the OBGYN commented on how well she held up for so long. In the final stages of pregnancy, she finally asked for an epidural. After over six hours, she was finally ready to start pushing, and we had a fantastic and caring nurse help us through the process. This portion of the labor was the most impactful for me. I could almost see the baby's head, but he kept moving as my wife pushed.  If she pushed left, he moved right, and vice-versa. It was getting really hard. I've seen a fair amount of blood (from noses, mouth, eyes, temples, etc.) due to my Muay Thai training, but nothing prepared me for this amount, especially from my loved one. I tried to stay calm, breathe, and wait for the nurses and doctors to help my wife. Finally, after about four hours of pushing in 10-15-minute intervals, four additional nurses and a doctor came into our labor room, and within 10 minutes, the OBGYN pulled the baby out and placed him on my wife's bosom. I will never forget that moment. It really felt magical; nothing will compare to seeing my son for the first time.

We stayed in the hospital for another two nights and two days and came home with a seven-pound baby. The initial days and nights were (â€¦and still are) tough, but I think we'll manage with all the help we're receiving from family.

Professionally, I got promoted. I wasn't expecting it this year, but it happened.

Personally, I grew my craft in Muay Thai by enrolling in [Ambush Muay Thai](https://www.ambushmuaythai.com/). I love the coaches! I enjoy honing my skills, realizing that I am still a beginner, though my ~2-year Krav Maga experience helped.

However, I didn't do a couple of things as much as I wanted this year:
  - I couldn't get into competitive programming as much as I wanted to.
  - I couldn't read as many books as I wanted to.

Personality-wise, I wish I were calmer, more soft-spoken to my family, and more direct with people professionally. I tend to be very nice to people at work, which has gotten me into trouble multiple times.

Looking forward to 2025!
