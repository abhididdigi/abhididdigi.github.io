I dedicate this post to two important people in this world: my mom and my dad.

Thanks a lot, UmaShankar, for your help and time. If I am posting this on my site, it is solely because of you. Also, I thank Siva Prasad for guiding me on how a website needs to be hosted when I was in the darkness of not even knowing what an A record is. And if you are reading this post, you _are_ really jobless.
