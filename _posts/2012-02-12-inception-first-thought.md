======================================================




<p>Add-on writing is a very complicated business, and for a novice like me in add-on development (though I know JavaScript to a certain extent), it is really <strike>difficult</strike>.</p>
<p>I went through the basic setup today, which will work with context menus, panels, and all, which, to be frank, is really confusing. Initially, I thought it was very simple, and I was almost one step away from getting my first version of this add-on. But then, when I really went into the details, yes, it was (and I presume will be) really complex.</p>
<p>The idea was this: When the user selects any text on the page, if that is an entry in the task table (mind you, here comes the suitability of the ServiceNow tool; all the child tables’ data references can be found in the task table), it should get its information in that little context box that comes up when they click on “What’s this Record.” Ah, I forgot, this option will be visible on the “right-click” menu when you select a particular text.</p>
<p>The summary—the way the add-on should look:</p>
<p>1. It should have two things: one to look-up, just as I had explained.</p>
<p>2. Then, the add-on should take a table and get the table’s data.</p>

<p>One enhancement that is planned is: It should also try to get the user who had raised the particular incident/problem/request.</p>
<p>Will this be possible in this very unpredictable life I am living? Let's see.</p>
