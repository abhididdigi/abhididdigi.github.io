## My First Harvest

I recently moved to Austin, TX and bought a home here. One of the first things that I did was to plant some trees. I planted Tomatoes, Meyer Lemon, Sprouts and Tulsai. Not just planting, one of the things that I religiously did was to water them atleast once and sometimes twice(in the initial phases). 

I did this for about three months, and in doing so, developed a fondness for these trees, especially the Tomato tree. 

Unfortunately, today, the tempatures in Austin dropped below zero, I never really thought that this is something that would happen in Austin and so didn't pay a lot of attention to it, but it did, and unfortunately a major portion of the Tomato tree wilted because of a frost bite. 

So...inorder to save atleast the current set of Green tomatoes, I cut them, and also top potion of the plant to save it(from anymore rot, diseases etc.,). I was hoping to make Rasam from these tomatoes, but because of this unexpected event, will have to ripen them inside my home, and try to make green tomato chutney. 

Some pictures follow....
