======================================================




Today 12-02-2012 is my first shot at firefox-addon Development. The first thing which was the most difficult thing to do was,To know which add-on do I want to create.Finally,it was very much simplified to "Building an add on which will greatly benefit the retrieval of data from/to Service Now Instances".

First things I was advised to do was to create a dev profile. I had a very bad experience with creating profiles in Firefox, so I downloaded the nightly release of it,for the same.

Any dev  from today will be done on the nightly release. Firefox-stable 10.01 will still remain my default browser xD. I signed up for the add-on builder,which should create the document/file/folder skeleton by itself, leaving the implementation details to me.Sadly, the service is available at <a href="https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/">https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/</a> .Hope fully once its up, i will be on my way to create a new addon. In the mean time, downloaded the alterante Add-on SDK,though i know very little of what an SDK is.

Wish me Good Luck!
