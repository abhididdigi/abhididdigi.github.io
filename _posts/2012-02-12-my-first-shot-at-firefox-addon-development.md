======================================================




Today, 12-02-2012, is my first shot at Firefox add-on development. The most difficult thing was to decide which add-on I wanted to create. Finally, it was simplified to "building an add-on that will greatly benefit the retrieval of data from/to ServiceNow instances."

The first thing I was advised to do was to create a dev profile. I had a very bad experience with creating profiles in Firefox, so I downloaded the nightly release of it for the same.

Any dev from today will be done on the nightly release. Firefox-stable 10.01 will still remain my default browser. I signed up for the add-on builder, which should create the document/file/folder skeleton by itself, leaving the implementation details to me. Sadly, the service is available at <a href="https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/">https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/</a>. Hopefully, once it's up, I will be on my way to creating a new add-on. In the meantime, I downloaded the alternate Add-on SDK, though I know very little of what an SDK is.

Wish me Good Luck!
